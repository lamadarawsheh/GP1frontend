Project’s Abstract:
Security Guard Patrolling within the Society Sectors as (Universities ,ministry buildings 
,medical complexes etc.) is probably the most important daily routine that keeps it secure. 
Unfortunately, Guard Patrol is one of the processes that is not tracked with rigor it 
deserves nor implemented orderly. And the alternative solutions involves spending an 
inordinate amount of money on security infrastructure, which is not convenient .
So here comes the importance of our project which is a “Security Guard Tracker”
mobile Application that assures the security of the system with high efficiency moreover 
low cost, and that’s by monitoring Security Guards and proving their presence during 
their shifts via internal QR codes in buildings that they will scan and use a authentication
technique to recognize their identity ,it also provides Scheduling Patrolling system 
according to prioritized regions to guarantee higher safety where needed ,finally dealing 
with lost luggage and reporting emergencie
